* Tips
  * **search path** of a node is a sequence of nodes from the root to the node
  * A node is an **ancestor** of node-d if it lies on the search path of node-d
  * If node-a is an ancestor of node-d, then node-d is a **descendant** of node-a
  * A node is called a **leaf** when it does not have any descendant
  * The **depth** of node-n is the number of nodes on the search path of node-n, not including node-n itself.
  * The **height** of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in that tree.
  * A **level** of a tree is all nodes at the same depth
  * A **full binary tree** is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
  * A **perfect binary tree** is a full binary tree in which all leaves are at the same depth
  * A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which every level is completed filled and all nodes are as far left as possible.
