* Tips
  * Two key ingredients to a successful use recursion are identifying the base cases and ensuring progress of converging to the solution.
  * Recursion is especially suitable when the **input is expressed using recursive rules** such as a computer grammar.

  * Recursion is good choice for **search, enumeration and divide-and-conquer**

  * Use recursion as **alternative to deeply nested iteration** loops

  * When **removing recursion** from a program, consider mimicking call stack with the **stack data structure**.

  * Recursion can be easily removed from a **tail-recursive** program by using a while-loop - no stack is needed.

  * If a recursive function may end up being called with the **same arguments** more than once, **cache** the results.
