* Tips
  * What makes DP different than divide-and-conquer is that the same subproblem may reoccur.
  * The key to solving a DP problem efficiently is finding a way to break the problem into subproblems such that

    * the original problem can be solved relatively easily once solutions to the subproblems are available

    * these subproblem solutions are cached
