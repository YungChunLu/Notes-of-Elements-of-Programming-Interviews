* Tips
  * heap sort, merge sort, and quick sort run in $$O(nlogn)$$
  * heap sort is in-place but not stable
  * merge sort is stable but not in-place
  * quick sort runs $$O(n^2)$$ in worst-case
  * An in-place sort is one which uses $$O(1)$$ space; a stable sort is one where entries which are equal appear in their original order.
