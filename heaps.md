* Tips
  * A heap is a specialized binary tree which is a complete binary tree.

  * The important property of a **max-heap** is that the key at each node is at least as great as the keys stored at its children. A **min-heap **has completely symmetric property.

  * A max-heap supports $$O(\log{n})$$ insertion, $$O(1)$$ lookup for max element, and $$O(\log{n})$$ deletion of the max element.
